# BigGAN-latent-space-loops
Uses the pre-trained BigGAN api from https://tfhub.dev/s?q=biggan and offers functionality for creating circular/looping curves for traversing latent space

Generates randomly placed circle in the 100d latent space and "twists" the circle to create more interesting trajectory while still keeping the looping behaviour.
